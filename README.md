# Home Lab

## Purpose
Self documenting my homelab in case of a failure or I need to refer to previous things done. This will also serve as a learning aid for myself as I will learn more about writing good documentation for multiple systems

## What will this cover

- Network Configuration
- Hardware Configuration
- Operating System Configuration
- Other important details that might need to be recalled
- Tasks to be completed

## What will this **NOT** cover?

- Personal Identifying Information of my network, this includes:
    - Specific WAN IP Addresses
    - Public Domain Names
    - Passwords and Keys (Hopefully I don't add these accidentally)
- "Temporary" fixes to problems. Instead, find **good** fixes
